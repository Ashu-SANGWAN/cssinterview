    <h3> Q 2. What is css box model?</h3>
    <p>
      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML
      element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual
      content. box model shows a structure of html in browser.
    </p>
    <h3> Q 3.What is the difference between padding and margin?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Margin : </b>The CSS margin properties are used to create space around
      elements, outside of any defined borders.
    </p>
    <h4>Negative values are allowed.</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Padding : </b> The CSS padding properties are used to generate space
        around an element's content, inside of any defined borders
        <h4>Negative values are not  allowed.</h4>
    </p>
    <h3>Q 4. Difference between flex row and column</h3>
    <p> <b>Row: </b> By Default The flexible items are displayed horizontally, as a row</p>
    <p>By using <u> flex direction</u> property we can align child container in Row</p>
    <p> <b>Column: </b>	The flexible items are displayed vertically, as a column</p>
    <p>By using <u> flex direction</u> property we can align child container in Column</p>
    <h3>Q 5. Justify-content allows you to do what?</h3>
    <p>The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container</p>
     <h3> Q 6. Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h3>
     <p> <b> position: relative -></b><u> in absolute the element is  not removed from the initial  flow.</u> places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, </p>
    <p> <b> position: absolute -> </b> <u> in absolute the element is removed from the flow.</u> places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.</p>
    <h3> Q 7. What is the z-index in CSS?</h3>
    <p> The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. As in, which one appears as if it is physically closer to you. z-index only affects elements that have a position value other than static (the default).
        Elements can overlap for a variety of reasons, for instance, relative positioning has nudged it over something else. Negative margin has pulled the element over another.
   <br> <b>The more z-index value the more element view on the top of others elements</b></p>
